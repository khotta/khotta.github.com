> ### 1.2.0 - the 19th of January, 2017
>> #### About the change
- Changes the prefix of tempfile name from '.SimpleRotate_tempfile_' to '.simple_rotate_tempfile_'.
- Replaces whitespace character(s) '/\s/' on tempfile name to '_'.
- Allows remaining a temfile even if #at_exit wasn't called.   
    A tempfile must be remain when your program is finished with some signals that dosen't call #at_exit.
    That case will happen when processes received some signals like INT, TERM, ...   
    I tried to handle this by trapping signals, but when a process received KILL signal SimpleRotate can't handle this.   
    That why I gave up on removing a tempfile precisely bacause I think it's impossible.  
    I mention that in the case of that #at_exit wasn't called a tempfile must be remain.   
    But if a tempfile is remaining, file locking must be done as well and SimpleRotate will provide you Mutex.   
    So I hope you don't mind that.
