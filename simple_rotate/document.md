## Public Class Methods
{% include header_method.html text="instance" id="instance" %}
> SimpleRotate class is implemented as singleton design pattern,   
> therefore you can take SimpleRotate object that's having your preference in any context.

> {% include small_header.html text='Returns' %}
> Returns an object of SimpleRotate.



## Public Instance Methods
{% include header_method.html text="init([file_name, [limit, [generation]]])" id="init" %}
> Specifies some informations about logging.


> {% include small_header.html text='Returns' %}
> Returns an object of SimpleRotate.

> {% include small_header.html text='Parameters' %}
> * {% include header_param.html text='file_name = File.absolute_path($0+".log")' %}
>> Specifies filename that is written logs. You must specify absolute path or relative path by `symbol` or `string`.

>> Default is `./<current filename>.log`.

>> When the file you set dosen't exist, the file will be created at this method was called.

>> The first of row in log file is an information of when the file was created.
>> Because some file system don't support to give file creation datetime.
>> You shold not delete it.

>> When the file you set already exists, append logs to the file instead of overwriting it.

>> When you prefer to write logs to STDOUT, You should specify this value to `:STDOUT`.


> * {% include header_param.html text='limit = "100M"' %}
>> When the log file reaches a specific size or specific term that are set as `limit`, SimpleRotate renames the log file and creates a new one.

>> There is necessary to set the value with `integer` or `string` for max limit size of log file, You can use the following words `"K", "M", "G"` like `"1G"`.
>> Default is `"100M"`.

>> For example, When specified like `SimpleRotate.init("/var/log/ruby/app/foo.log", "500M")`, log files are written untill it reaches its size to be "500M" and over.

>> You must not set like `"500MB"`, the keywords are only accepted `"K", "M", "G"`. Others will be removed by `to_i`. Therefore `500MB` will be converted to `500` and it means 500 byte.

>> Log file's size is checked when `#init`, `#w` methods are called. After that if file size reaches specific size, the log file is renamed and new log file is created, after logs are written to the new one.
>> When renaming is done, old log files are renamed as followng `file_name.1`, `file_name.2`, `file_name.3`, `file_name.4`. The older log file, The bigger number.

>> When you set `"DAILY"`, `"WEEKLY"`, `"MONTHLY"` as `string`, you can rotate log files by specific term.

>> * `"DAILY"`: Writes logs to the log file just 24 hours from it has been created.
>> * `"WEEKLY"`: Writes logs to the log file just 7 days from it has been created.
>> * `"MONTHLY"`: Writes logs to the log file just 30 days from it has been created.

>> The renaming format of log files is `file_name.YYYYmmdd`.

> * {% include header_param.html text='generation=0' %}
>> Maximam number of rotations. Renamed log files are rotated by this count.

>> For example, If you set `4` to value of `generation`, old log files are rotated between `file_name.1`, `file_name.2`, `file_name.3`, `file_name.4`.

>> Default value is `0`. If it is set `0`, old log files aren't deleted.

> This example is calling the method with a block. When exits from a block the I/O port of it is closed automatically.

> For example, when `#warn` is called, log's seriousness is switched to `WARN`, therefore the defined constant [`$LOG`](#logging_format) will be converted to `WARN`.

> Default log's seriousness is `INFO`.

> {% include small_header.html text='Returns' %}
